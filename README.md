# ETL_project_2
### For this mini project, we worked as a team of 3 to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform campaign crowdfunding data. After we transformed the data, we created CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema.
### The main notebook is ETL_Mini_Project_JOchuida_NOKarma_ABelfiglio.ipynb. Individual workbooks can be found in Starter_Files. Input and output files are in the Resources folder. Individual outputs associated with the indiviudal workbooks can be found in the archive subfolder within the Resources folder. A schema sql file in the Resources folder will create a database and four tables to import the csv output files.
### The collaborators for this project were Andrew Belfiglio, Nick O'Karma, and Jackie Ochuida.
