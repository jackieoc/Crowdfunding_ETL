# ETL_project_2
For this mini project, we worked as a team of 3 to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After we transformed the data, we created CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema.
